    SELECT * FROM benn.advanced_country_debt_indicators

Exercise #2
Create a new DB named countries in your local mysql instance.
    CREATE DATABASE countries;

Exercise #3
Create a new table named country_debt with an adequate structure for the data in step 1
+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field       | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| country     | text    | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| year        | year(4) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| public_debt | float   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| gdp_growth  | float   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| id          | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

Exercise #4
Load the data from step 1 into the table you created on step 3:
 LOAD DATA INFILE 'country-data.csv' INTO TABLE country_debt FIELDS
  TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY "" LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;


Exercise #5
Create a query that selects the average gdp growth for each country
 between the years 1990 and 2000. Show country name and gdp growth.
SELECT country, AVG(gdp_growth) FROM country_debt WHERE year > 1990 AND year < 2000 GROUP BY country;


Exercise #6
Export your query to a file named NinetiesGDP.csv - use commas to 
separate the values and quotes to enclose each field.

        SELECT country, AVG(gdp_growth)
        FROM country_debt 
        WHERE year > 1989 AND year < 2001 GROUP BY country 
        INTO OUTFILE 'NinetiesGDP.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
        ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';

Exercise #7
Create a query that sorts countries by historically highest GDP growth. 
Show country and GDP growth, and show only 20 results. Take all available
 yearly data into account. Export this query to a file named top20GDP.csv
        SELECT country, SUM(gdp_growth) AS growth 
        FROM country_debt GROUP BY country 
        ORDER BY growth DESC 
        LIMIT 20 
        INTO OUTFILE 'top20gdp.csv' FIELDS TERMINATED 
        BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n';

Exercise #8
Which was the country with the largest debt public debt in 1999?    
        SELECT country, MAX(public_debt) AS "largest debt public"
        FROM country_debt
        GROUP BY country;


Exercise #9
Which are the ten countries with the highest historical debt to gdp ratio?
        SELECT country, SUM(public_debt) AS "Greater historical debt public"
        FROM benn.advanced_country_debt_indicators
        GROUP BY country
        ORDER BY "Greater historical debt public" DESC
        LIMIT 10;
